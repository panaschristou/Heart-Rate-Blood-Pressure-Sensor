# Heart Rate and Blood Pressure Sensor
This is a project for the Real Time Embedded Systems class from the ECE department of Graduate NYU Tandon.

## Implementation
- We used a honeywell sensor along with a processor with an integrated screen to create a heart rate and blood pressure sensor. \\
- We implemented the algorithms to calculate the heart rate and the blood pressure based on the sensor inputs from the honeywell sensor and displayed the information on the screen. \\
- The user was given instructions on the screen on how to use the sensor and measure his/her own blood pressure and heartrate with instructions on when to pump air and when to stop. \\
- The project was coded in C++ and with PlatformIO.
